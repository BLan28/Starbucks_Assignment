### 1. Installation
To replicate this project, ensure that you have the following libraries installed, which are not included in the default Anaconda distribution: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and wordcloud.

### 2. Project Motivation
The main goal of this project is to implement an hypothesis testing and analyze the results using Python to see if the advertising promotion would bring more customers to purchase a specific product priced at $10. Then using the training data to understand what patterns in V1-V7 (abstract customers' features) indicate that a promotion should be provided to a user. 

The context and data source is from Starbucks takeaway assignment for Data Scientist candidates.

### 3. File Descriptions
This repository includes 2 data files: training.csv and Test.csv. Each file contains relevant data on the customers receiving the promotion and decided whether to purchase the item. The dataset contains two key columns for each data point: one indicating whether an individual was sent a promotion for the product, and another indicating whether that individual eventually made a purchase. Additionally, each individual has seven abstractly labeled features (V1-V7) associated with them.

### 4. How to Interact with the Project
The Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the data analysis process, including data exploration, hypothesis testing, and build Machine Learning model. Key findings from this project include using A/B test to prove the impact of promotion on the purchase decision of customer and find the right customer to send promotion to optimize the cost.
